# Configurator Example Application

This is an example application using the Onshape external APIs to provide a CAD configurator.

A running version of this can be found at: http://configurator.cae.tech

The application comprises a Java server and an Angular client. The server uses the Onshape Java client (https://github.com/onshape-public/java-client) to access assembly, part, and configuration data from Onshape. The client includes components for viewing 3D models with WebGL (via three.js), and for interaction with the server component to fetch or change configuration data.

As well as configurators, this could be used as the basis of a range of applications that use Onshape as a platform for engineering data - such as fetching geometry of a given configuration for CAE analyses, or providing 3D views of products in an online catalog.
